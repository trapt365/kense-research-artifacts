## Market Segments Overview

### Segment A: Owner-led SMBs in cash-sensitive industries
**Size**: 83.33% (25/30)  
**Overall Score**: 67/100

Owner-led SMBs in cash-sensitive industries (FMCG, retail/wholesale, light manufacturing, logistics, HoReCa-adjacent) running a weekly "financial snapshot" to decide payments and protect margins. They rely on Sheets/Excel + 1C exports + chats + accountant/controller to stitch a trusted view together.

### Segment B: Fast-growing regulated B2B service operators
**Size**: 10% (3/30)  
**Overall Score**: 62/100

Fast-growing regulated B2B service operators (e.g., clinics, security; ~20–100 employees) trying to make chat + Excel + basic ERP/accounting behave like a reliable operating system. They need audit-safe coordination + a trusted financial picture to avoid payroll failures, fines, and delivery disruption.

### Segment C: Owner-led retail & hospitality micro-businesses
**Size**: 6.67% (2/30)  
**Overall Score**: 68/100

Owner-led retail & hospitality micro-businesses with volatile daily revenue and fixed obligations, doing daily inputs + weekly consolidation to prioritize payments. They hire cheap/familiar tools (Sheets + chats + external accountant) to stay afloat and sleep at night.

### Segment D: Lean founder-led B2B service firms
**Size**: 6.67% (2/30)  
**Overall Score**: 70/100

Lean founder-led B2B service firms (event agencies, dev studios; ~10–30 people) running many parallel projects with peaks. They need a single trusted view of cash + project profitability fast to make hiring/scope/payment decisions without "financial fog."

### Segment E: Growing B2B agencies / IT delivery firms
**Size**: 6.67% (2/30)  
**Overall Score**: 74/100

Growing B2B agencies / IT delivery firms where distributed execution breaks visibility, forcing "weekly archaeology" across chats, Excel, CRM, accounting. They want a standardized weekly dashboard that stays reliable during peak-load weeks and protects margins/cash.

### Segment F: 10–30 person B2B service firms
**Size**: 6.67% (2/30)  
**Overall Score**: 71/100

10–30 person B2B service firms (often digital marketing studios) hitting recurring "visibility breaks" at weekly reviews, month-end, KPI dips, client reporting, and scaling moves. They need to reconcile fragmented performance/ops/finance data into a view they can act on and defend—without migrations killing momentum.

## Key Takeaway

The market is dominated by **Segment A (83.33%)**—a big "weekly cash-control" mass where the main competitor is habit + the incumbent stack (Sheets/1C/chats), so wins come from low-risk layering and reliability improvements, not "replace Excel."

The highest attractiveness scores sit in the **B2B services visibility-break segments** (E: 74, F: 71, D: 70)—smaller today, but with clearer willingness to pay for faster, defensible decisions when their current glue stack breaks under pressure.

**Segment B (62)** is strategically valuable but execution-heavy (regulation, audits, change management), while **Segment C (68)** has urgency but risks fragmentation and "free incumbent" gravity—worth exploring only with a very seamless wedge and distribution plan.
