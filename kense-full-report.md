### Overview

Segment Map (Panoramic View) - segmentation analysis for Kense market research.

### Market Segments Overview

| Segment | Who they are | Size | Overall Score |
|---------|--------------|------|---------------|
| **Segment A** | Owner‑led SMBs in cash-sensitive industries (FMCG, retail/wholesale, light manufacturing, logistics, HoReCa-adjacent) running a weekly "financial snapshot" to decide payments and protect margins. | 83.33% (25/30) | 67/100 |
| **Segment B** | Fast-growing regulated B2B service operators (e.g., clinics, security; ~20–100 employees) trying to make chat + Excel + basic ERP/accounting behave like a reliable operating system. | 10% (3/30) | 62/100 |
| **Segment C** | Owner-led retail & hospitality micro-businesses with volatile daily revenue and fixed obligations, doing daily inputs + weekly consolidation to prioritize payments. | 6.67% (2/30) | 68/100 |
| **Segment D** | Lean founder-led B2B service firms (event agencies, dev studios; ~10–30 people) running many parallel projects with peaks. | 6.67% (2/30) | 70/100 |
| **Segment E** | Growing B2B agencies / IT delivery firms where distributed execution breaks visibility, forcing "weekly archaeology" across chats, Excel, CRM, accounting. | 6.67% (2/30) | 74/100 |
| **Segment F** | 10–30 person B2B service firms (often digital marketing studios) hitting recurring "visibility breaks" at weekly reviews, month-end, KPI dips, client reporting. | 6.67% (2/30) | 71/100 |

### Key Takeaway

The market is dominated by **Segment A (83.33%)**—a big "weekly cash-control" mass where the main competitor is habit + the incumbent stack (Sheets/1C/chats), so wins come from low-risk layering and reliability improvements, not "replace Excel."

The highest attractiveness scores sit in the **B2B services visibility-break segments** (E: 74, F: 71, D: 70)—smaller today, but with clearer willingness to pay for faster, defensible decisions when their current glue stack breaks under pressure.

**Segment B (62)** is strategically valuable but execution-heavy (regulation, audits, change management), while **Segment C (68)** has urgency but risks fragmentation and "free incumbent" gravity—worth exploring only with a very seamless wedge and distribution plan.

## Detailed Segment Analysis

### Segment D: "Founder-led event agencies and digital studios (10–30 people)"

**Overall score**: 70/100

#### Job Story

**When**: I run a lean, low-margin B2B service business (event agency / digital studio) with multiple parallel projects, seasonal peaks, and tight deadlines, and my financial + operational data is scattered across spreadsheets, chats, and tools—creating cash-flow uncertainty, margin blur, or delivery risk.

**I want**: to quickly bring order to execution and numbers: standardize project tracking (costs/revenue/tags), run regular reviews (cash, budget, payments), and close projects with clear profitability—so decisions (payments, hiring, scope, delivery commitments) are based on trusted data, not improvisation.

**So that**: I don't lose money and protect growth: keep margins predictable, avoid cash gaps/overruns, and still scale revenue—while personally feeling calm, in control, and confident in front of the team and clients.

#### Who they are

Lean, founder-led, project-based B2B service companies—most commonly event agencies and digital/custom dev studios, typically ~10–30 employees.

**Segment size**: 6.7% (2/30)

#### Job Story importance and frequency

- **Importance (avg)**: 9.6/10 — this is a survival + growth loop
- - **Frequency (avg)**: Regularly — a mix of recurring cadence (weekly/twice-weekly cash, payments, budget vs actuals) plus project-based spikes
 
  - #### Solutions hired for this Job Story
 
  - 1. Manual control stack: Google Sheets dashboards + accounting tools (e.g., QuickBooks) + Docs/Notion + Slack/chats
    2. 2. External finance help for "reset": external accountant/bookkeeper/financial consultant
       3. 3. Embedded delivery tracking + routines: PM tooling + weekly reconciliation
         
          4. **Satisfaction with current solutions (avg)**: 8.8/10 — they work "well enough," but not without a recurring operational tax.
         
          5. #### Problems with these solutions
         
          6. - Scattered data sources → slow consolidation, missing details, inconsistent numbers
             - - Manual work + human error in tagging/reconciliation/dashboards → delays, rework, reduced trust
               - - Coordination delays / handoff waiting → decisions stall and timelines slip
                 - - Peak-season overload → reviews expand, burnout risk rises, quality drops
                   - - Resistance to standardization → templates/tags feel like bureaucracy
                     - - Integration/dependency risks → extra cycles and unexpected cost/effort
                      
                       - ---

                       #### Job Story

                       **When**: I'm in a growing B2B service company (often a digital marketing studio) with distributed team and manual "glue workflows" (Sheets/Excel + chats + GA + CRM), and I hit a moment where numbers stop matching (weekly/month-end review, KPI dip, client deadline, scaling decision).

                       **I want**: to quickly turn scattered operational/financial and performance data into a single, reliable view (dashboards/reports) I can act on and defend.

                       **So that**: I can hit growth KPIs, save money through efficiency, and avoid losses from errors/cash/compliance risks—while feeling calm, in control, and confident the team isn't drowning in manual work.

                       #### Who they are

                                         - - Data quality drift: inconsistent tagging/standards, duplicates/gaps
                                           - - Adoption resistance: new rules feel like "bureaucracy"
                                             - - Latency kills decisions: analytics delays → reacting late → KPI damage
                                              
                                               - ---

                                               **I want**: Get a reliable, up-to-date view of cash inflows and outflows (and a prioritized payment plan) fast enough to decide what to pay now vs later.

                                               **So that**: Avoid losing money (fines, debt, missed obligations), save money via operational efficiency, and keep the business stable—while feeling calm and in control.
