## Job Story

**When**: I run a small-to-mid-sized business with tight budgets and limited headcount, where demand and revenue fluctuate (seasonality, retailer/HoReCa spikes), and our financial data is scattered across Excel/Sheets, 1C exports, and chats—especially when the weekly planning cycle hits and payment deadlines (payroll, suppliers, taxes) are coming or "low cash / urgent change" signals appear.

**I want**: to consolidate sales/operations/finance inputs into a single accurate view of cash position, margins, and upcoming payments, and use it to approve and execute the right financial decisions fast (what to pay now, what to delay, where to cut/spend).

**So that**: I maintain stable cash flow and healthy margins while hitting growth/efficiency KPIs (earn more, save money, avoid losses like fines/downtime/overstock gaps) and feel calm control instead of constant firefighting.

## Who They Are

- **Company type**: Small-to-mid-sized businesses (~20–95 employees)
- - **Industries**: FMCG/light manufacturing, retail/wholesale, logistics, services, HoReCa-adjacent
  - - **Key characteristic**: Tight budgets, low-to-medium IT maturity, cash-sensitive, volatile industries
    - - **Decision maker**: Owner-CEO / Managing Director (still close to day-to-day decisions)
      - - **Reality**: Hard payment deadlines + volatile demand + fragmented data
        - - **Post-chaos**: Many already invested 3–6 months into templates and routines
         
          - **Common language**: "weekly snapshot," "one set of numbers," "keep cash under control," "avoid cash gaps," "decision cockpit," "firefighting," "data fog"

          ## Job Story Importance and Frequency

          - **Importance**: 9.8/10 — "operational survival"

            ## Current Solutions

            Their "good enough" stack:

            1. **Excel / Google Sheets** dashboards & templates (sometimes with Power Query)
            2. 2. **1C exports** as compliance/accounting anchor
               3. 3. **Corporate chats** (Telegram/WhatsApp/Slack) for hand-offs, clarifications, approvals
                  4. 4. **Accountant / controller** (internal or freelance) to clean, standardize, reconcile
                    
                     5. **Satisfaction**: 8.6/10 (works most weeks)
                     6. **Value-for-effort**: High ROI
                     7. **Habit strength**: 8.5/10 (deeply embedded, strong inertia)

                     9. ## Problems with Current Solutions
                    
                     10. 1. **Manual data entry + cleaning**: mismatched sources, duplicates, inconsistent naming → rework
                         2. 2. **Integration/sync instability**: 1C ↔ Excel/Sheets failures force manual fixes
                            3. 3. **Coordination delays**: inputs and approvals stall when someone is unavailable
                               4. 4. **Peak-load breakdowns**: process stretches from hours to half-day/1–2 days
                                  5. 5. **Resistance to standardization**: teams push back, skip templates
                                     6. 6. **Finance talent constraints**: hard to hire/retain strong accountant/controller

                                                    - **Handoff chain**: Sales → Ops/Production → Finance → CEO approval → execution
                                                   
                                                    - **Breakpoints**: Late inputs, mismatched numbers, clarification chasing

                                                              ## Adoption / Switching Reality
